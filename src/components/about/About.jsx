                    <p className="a-sub">
                        I am a finalist BEng (NQF Level 8) Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Pretoria, 
                        with only one module left to complete remotely in the first semester of 2022.
                    </p>
                    <p className="a-desc">
                        I am quick to learn, and can adapt to a different environment and culture swiftly. I am deadline driven, yet
                        believe in quality work, as such, I am dedicated and hardworking. I have excellent creativity and problem solving skills. 
                        I prefer reading on literature or catching up on television in my spare time, and when feeling lazy,
                        I go for a jog to keep my mind and body healthy and active. I value honesty and transparency, and honour
                        constructive criticism because I believe in learning and growing. Although a bit shy at first, I have a lively
                        attitude over time and engage well with others. In trying to overcome being shy, I have been active in
                        tutoring different lessons in the last few years, and have been a part of different teams in different modules.

                                I have extensive academic experience in Python, for which I even had an opportunity to tutor the offered module, i.e., MPR 213 â€“ Programming and Information
                                Technology with the University of Pretoria, along with a section of Microsoft Excel.
